Java TMX Viewer example
=======================

This is a simple example application showing how to use libtiled-java to load
and view a Tiled map file.

Trying it out in IntelliJ IDEA
------------------------------

Open tiled-java.ipr in IntelliJ IDEA and press Run to launch it. It will popup
a dialog with a field to enter parameters. The map you want to view should be
entered there.

Trying it out from the command line
-----------------------------------

The tmxviewer-java needs libtiled-java to be compiled first to add libtiled
dependency to your local Maven repository.

The Apache 'Maven' build tool is used to build from the command line.

* Run 'mvn clean install' in the libtiled-java directory to build libtiled.jar
* Go to the tmxviewer-java directory and run 'mvn clean install' there to compile it
* Launch the TMX Viewer using 'java -jar tmxviewer-<Version>.jar [file]'
